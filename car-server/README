Car DB server


Basic Python HTTP server with some xml parsing into a hash of hashes
and serve Javascript requests from that to update the web ui.
The script gets the job done, is rather hacky, neither pretty, nor am
I fluent in Javascript...

Access would be via port 8000 on the layout computer.

Usage:
- put SVL post-printing XML database file "SVL_Base_sess_post.xml"
into same directory as server (or symlink to the actual file)
- ./server.py  , logs get printed to stdout
- go to http://10.0.0.25:8000
- On the web page, touch type any part of any car number on the
layout. The table underneath the number pad gets populated with
matching cars.
You see where the car is, where it's supposed go, and on which train.
