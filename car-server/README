Car DB server


Basic Python HTTP server with some xml parsing into a hash of hashes
and serve Javascript requests from that to update the web ui.
The script gets the job done, is rather hacky, neither pretty, nor am
I fluent in Javascript...

Access would be via port 8000 on the layout computer.

Usage

- ./server.py  , logs get printed to stdout


Preparation

- go to http://10.0.0.25:8000
- click the Upload link
- upload the Switchster XML file for this session, as well as the
  respective Yardmaster Car Report for Nowheres


User Interface

On the web page, touch type any part of any car number on the
layout. The table underneath the number pad gets populated with
matching cars.
You see where the car is, where it's supposed go, and on which train.


Switch List Mode

As an experimental feature one can now create switchlists for a 
string of cars:
- enable Switch List Mode (SLM) in lower right corner
- enter a unique name for the switch list
- touch type the car numbers to be sorted in order
- in the table touch the car you are looking up and it gets added
  to the switch list. The count "N cars" link in the lower right corner
  will increase.
- once you have enough cars selected, click the "N cars" link in the lower 
  right corner.
- a table with destinations for all selected cars is shown

Caveats:
- there are some rough edges with Switch List Mode
- switch lists are kept in memory of server, so server restart will wipe
  all switch lists
- switch lists can not be removed or modified at the moment
